						<h2>About Inventorum</h2>
						<p>
						Inventorum’s software enables small retailers to manage their offline and online businesses by supporting daily processes such as point of sale and inventory management.
						Inventorum combines cash management, inventory management, customer support and e-commerce capability in one system.
						<br /><br />
						Founder and CEO, Christoph Brem, found his passion for small retailers after seeing his mother Hannelore run a small fashion boutique in Lower Bavaria for over 30 years. She ran her shop with passion, offered good customer service and had a keen eye for supply and demand. For many small businesses, these qualities are no longer enough to keep up with big brand retailers and the change in consumer habits, owed largely in part to the internet. This is where Inventorum steps in.
						E-nabling local retail.
